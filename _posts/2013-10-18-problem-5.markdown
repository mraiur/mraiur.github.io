# Smallest multiple

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is <dfn title="divisible with no remainder">evenly divisible</dfn> by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


```
var found = false;
var num = 1;

var allDevided;
var cnt = 1;

while( found === false ){
    allDevided = true;
    cnt = 1;
    for(; cnt <;= 20; cnt++ ){
        if(num%cnt!==0){
            allDevided = false;
        }
    }
    if(allDevided){
        found = true;
        console.log("=>", num);
    }
    num++;
}

```
