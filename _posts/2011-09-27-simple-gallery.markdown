In a while i needed a simple gallery without  logins, uploaders, databases etc. Wanted to put it as a front in my development server where i just dumped tons of pictures. Searched for something like that there where some usable but not quite solutions. I put a simple php gallery with auto thumbnail generation and a lightbox and thats it.

You can find it on github here :  [Image Gallery](https://github.com/mraiur/Image-Gallery)
