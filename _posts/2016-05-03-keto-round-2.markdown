The goal this time is to have a better plan and a time limit for the "run".
There will be several points that will help me achieve better results.

# Intermittent fasting
Will try to achieve a 7/17 or 8/16 hour cycles.

All eating to be done in the 7/8 hour time window and no calorie intake for the next 16/17 hours.


# Keto diet

This time all the food for the day must be under 2200 calories.

To help with that i downloaded to try ( [Keto - Low Carb Diet Tracking](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.venninteractive.ssketo) ).

For the recipes most of them will be from here ( [LINDA'S LOW CARB MENUS & RECIPES](http://genaw.com/lowcarb/index.html) ).
It offers many recipes and details for the portions, thus helping to track the carbs/fat/protein intake.


# Supplements

The keto diet is lacking some vital ingredients most of the time. To reduce or maybe remove the side effects of it and from the training a will take additional:

- Vitamin B Complex ( [B-100 Complex](http://fitness1.bg/витамини/natrol/natrol-b-100-complex/) )
- Omega 3 ( [Omega 3 Fish Oil PACK](http://fitness1.bg/стакове/pure-nutrition/pure-omega3-fish-oil-pack-1/) )
- Selenium ( [Selenium](http://fitness1.bg/минерали/pure-nutrition/pure-nutrition-selenium-100t/) )
- Calmacin Forte ( calcium, magnesium, zinc, vitamin D3)

- (fat burner to be updated after delivery )
