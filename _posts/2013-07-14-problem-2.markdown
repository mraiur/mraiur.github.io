# Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```
var prev = 0;
var next = 1;
var temp = 0;

var step = 1;
var stepSum = 0;
while((prev + next) < 4000000) {
    temp = prev + next;
    prev = next;
    next = temp;
    if( temp%2 === 0) {
        stepSum+= temp;
    }
    step++;
}
console.log(stepSum);
```
