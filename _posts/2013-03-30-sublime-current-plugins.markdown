At the moment my plugin list :

- [Package Manager](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
    Its the core for all plugin installations.</li>
- [Automatic Backups](https://github.com/joelpt/sublimetext-automatic-backups)
    Version control is one thing but a the direct "CRTL+Z" even if you reboot your pc is very useful
- [PlainTask](https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks)
    A todo-list plugin with checks and groups etc. But to read it its not required to be opened from sublime
- [SideBarEnhancements](https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements)
    Adds additional context-menu options
- [SublimeLinter](https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter)
    A plugin helping you not to mage syntax errors. For JS adds standardization hints.
- [TernJs](https://github.com/marijnh/tern_for_sublime)
    In JavaScript files, the package will handle autocompletion.
- [TodoReview](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/TodoReview)
    Walk your code and gather information for TODO comments and not only.
- [Goto​Documentation](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/GotoDocumentation)
    A sublime text 2/3 plugin to jump to documentation for the current word.
