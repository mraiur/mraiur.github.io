As i don't like to constantly use the mouse to do some "text"/code related stuff.
[Tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net) is the fix for the terminal :)

Normally for ssh client on windows i use [mRemoteNG](http://www.mremoteng.org) but when using one machine to have opened several tabs just not to quit a task to do something else its not ok.

So for a cheat sheet :

# And some links

- [Maximizing‚Äù a pane in tmux](http://superuser.com/questions/238702/maximizing-a-pane-in-tmux)
    And sometimes its ok to use mouse :P
- [On mouse click select pane](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/44634/tmux-change-window-pane-by-mouse-click)

1. Open Tmux
2. CRTL+B and type:

```
set -g mouse-select-pane on
```
