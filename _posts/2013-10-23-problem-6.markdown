# Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


```
var cnt = 1;
var num = 0;
var sum = 0;
var maxNaturalNumber = 100;

while( cnt <= maxNaturalNumber ){
    sum+= Math.pow(cnt, 2);
    num+= cnt;
    cnt++;
}
console.log("->sum of quares", sum);
console.log("->square of sum", Math.pow(num, 2));
console.log("->difference", Math.pow(num, 2) - sum);

```
