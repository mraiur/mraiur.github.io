In my first problems in beginning c++ development is the setup of a IDE. Tried Eclipse for C++, no simple hello world.

After that tested NetBeans and i think its better and one step closer to simple hello world. Strangely CodeBlocks was the most descriptive in what is not configured, forgot to install the gdb package for cygwin.

Found a good tutorial for setup codeblocks [here](http://cs.calvin.edu/curriculum/cs/112/resources/installingEclipse/cygwin/)

And now continue to fiddle with the IDE and test cross-platform builds etc.
